# Privacy Policy for Chat Message Navigator

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Introduction

Chat Message Navigator ("we", "our", or "the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that helps users navigate and locate questions within long conversations on supported chat platforms (DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and Gemini). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.**

The Chat Message Navigator extension operates entirely locally within your browser. Specifically:

- **No Data Collection**: We do not collect any personal information, chat content, user queries, or conversation history.
- **No Data Storage**: We do not store any data on your device or on remote servers. All processing happens in memory and is cleared when you close the browser tab.
- **No Data Transmission**: We do not send any data to external servers, analytics services, or third parties.

## How the Extension Works

The extension works by:

1. **Reading Page Content**: The extension reads the DOM (Document Object Model) of supported chat pages to detect question elements. This reading happens entirely within your browser.

2. **Local Processing**: All question detection and navigation features are processed locally in your browser's memory. No data leaves your device.

3. **No Persistent Storage**: The extension does not use Chrome's storage API, localStorage, or any other persistent storage mechanism. All data is temporary and exists only while the page is open.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab when you click the extension icon.
- **scripting**: no scripting.
- **storage**: no data storage.
- **host_permissions**: Allows the extension to access specific chat domains:
  - `https://chat.deepseek.com/*`
  - `https://chat.openai.com/*`
  - `https://chatgpt.com/*`
  - `https://gemini.google.com/*`

These permissions are necessary for the extension to function, but they do not result in any data collection or transmission.

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party analytics services, tracking tools, or external APIs. The extension operates completely independently without any external dependencies for data processing.

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. However, you have the right to:

- **Uninstall the Extension**: You can remove the extension at any time through Chrome's extension management page (`chrome://extensions/`).
- **Review Source Code**: The extension's source code is available for review to verify our privacy claims.

## Compliance

This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with:
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Other applicable privacy laws

Since we do not collect any personal data, the extension inherently complies with these regulations.

## Conclusion

Chat Message Navigator is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe that your conversations and data should remain private and local to your device. The extension provides navigation functionality without compromising your privacy.

**Summary**: Chat Message Navigator does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. All processing happens locally in your browser, and no information leaves your device.
